### Customization 
This section is optionnal and show an approach how to use KeepassXC with the file hosted on your WedDAV server.  

**‚ö†Ô∏è This section is related to KDE**

The goal is to overrides commands launched when opening KeepassXC.  
In KDE, we create application and specify commands to launch them. To do so :   
1. Install [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/#linux) on your computer. 
1. Make sure to launch it with `keepass` command in terminal.
1. Clone this repository, go in the folder cloned and make script files executable :
    ```bash
    chmod u+X *.sh
    ```
1. Right click on `Application Launcher` and `Edit Applications` in the menu.
1. Add a custom entry `Keepass` and set a command to launch the `database_retrieve.sh` file (don't forget to use the path where the file is located).
1. Save the changes, you're now ready to use KeepassXC with Keeweb üòÑ.

**Tests**

To check if the script is working, open the `database_retrieve.sh` file and run it.
It should retrieve the database from Keeweb and save it in `${GK_PATH}/${GK_CONFIG_FILE}` file. 
Try to modify some entry with the KeepassXC application and check if the changes are repercuted on Keeweb.
